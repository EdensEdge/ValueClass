# DataClass
Let's you create [DataClasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) in JS

# Why use them
Data Classes are:
  * immutable
  * comparable
  * easy to create

*note: DataClass requires WeakRef (Node 14.6.0, ES2021). The code doesn't support CommonJS or ES modules, but its pretty simple so you can add it yourself*
